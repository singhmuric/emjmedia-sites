# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to `main`. There are no long-lived release branches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

Preferred channel: [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/garrettjsmith/localseoskills/security/advisories/new) via GitHub Security Advisories.

Fallback: DM a maintainer on the [community Discord](https://discord.gg/BFtGYWBmDw).

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours. Critical issues (RCE, credential exposure, destructive shell behavior) are triaged first.

When reporting, include:

- Affected file / skill / script
- Reproduction steps (shell commands, env vars, inputs)
- Observed behavior and expected behavior
- Your environment (OS, shell, git version)

## Scope

In scope:

- Install and uninstall scripts (`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `install.ps1`, `uninstall.ps1`)
- Skill files that execute shell commands or write to the filesystem
- Task templates that run without human approval
- Dependencies pinned in the repo

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party MCP servers or data providers (report upstream)
- Issues that require physical access or an already-compromised shell
- Social-engineering a maintainer

## Hardening Guidance for Contributors

### Destructive scripts

Install and uninstall scripts must refuse to operate on:

- The filesystem root (`/`)
- Any top-level system directory (`/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt`, `/tmp`, `/root`, and bare `/Users` or `/home`) — note that paths *inside* the current user's `$HOME` are allowed via a home-dir carve-out, which is what lets the default install at `~/.claude/skills/localseoskills` work
- The user's `$HOME` directory itself (as opposed to paths beneath it)
- Raw input paths shorter than 10 characters (after trailing-slash normalization)
- Paths containing `..` traversal segments (refused outright — the guard does not attempt to resolve them)

Both the raw input and the resolved absolute path are checked against the blocklist (dual-candidate match). Keep that pattern in new scripts.

### Testing destructive scripts

Never run install or uninstall scripts with `--force` against a real path you care about. Recommended sandbox:

1. Clone the repo anywhere disposable (e.g. `$HOME/lss-dev-sandbox/clone`)
2. Set `LSS_INSTALL_DIR` to a disposable path **under `$HOME`** (e.g. `$HOME/lss-dev-sandbox/install`). The uninstall guard refuses top-level system directories like `/tmp`, `/opt`, `/var`, and bare `/Users` or `/home`; it only allows paths inside your own `$HOME`.
3. Exercise the guard with known-dangerous inputs (`/`, `$HOME`, `/etc`, `$HOME/../../Users`, etc.) and confirm each one refuses before reaching any `rm`
4. Only then test the happy path against your sandbox install dir

If you use Claude Code to run these tests, the session-level bash guard (`bash-guard.py`) blocks `uninstall*.sh --force` by default as a defense-in-depth layer. Substitute the prompt-driven form (`echo "yes" | bash uninstall.sh`) when you need to exercise the real uninstall path.

### CI

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow runs the dangerous-input battery on every PR to `main`. A guard regression blocks the merge.
