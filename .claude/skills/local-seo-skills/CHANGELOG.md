## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-17

Initial public release.

### Added
- Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Enables one-command install via `/plugin install local-seo-skills@garrettjsmith-localseo` in Claude Code 1.0.33+ and the Claude Desktop plugin browser.
- Install and uninstall scripts for macOS, Linux, and Windows (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `uninstall.sh`, `uninstall.ps1`). Idempotent updates, atomic clone-to-temp-then-move, concurrency lockfile, pre-flight writability check, briefs auto-backup to `$HOME/.claude/lss-briefs-backup-<timestamp>`, and multi-layer dangerous-path guards on uninstall (trusted-home derivation, 8.3 short-name rejection, UNC/device-namespace rejection, reparse-point rejection on the target and descendants, and origin-URL / dirty-worktree / detached-HEAD checks before `git reset --hard`).
- Brand assets (`assets/`): wordmark, cover image, social preview image, logo mark, and favicons. SVG masters with PNG renders matching localseoskills.com brand tokens.
- Task index at `tasks/README.md`.

### Changed
- Full README rebuild: install moved to the top, 5-badge row, table of contents, 6 platform-specific install paths, outcome-driven Quick Start examples, "What Makes This Different" section surfacing the briefs, scheduled tasks, and LocalSEOData moats, 15-row scheduled task template table.
- `VERSIONS.md` regenerated from frontmatter: 26 strategy + 12 tool + 1 meta (`brief`) skill, every entry backed by the corresponding `SKILL.md`'s `metadata.version`.

### Security
- Pre-v1 versions of `uninstall.sh` contained a path-traversal guard that missed `$HOME/../../Library`, `/System/Library`, case variants on case-insensitive filesystems, and several Linux/macOS top-level roots. The v1 guard resolves `INSTALL_DIR` against a trusted home derived from `id -un` (bash) or Win32 `[Environment]::GetFolderPath` (PowerShell), rejects paths containing `..` segments outright, refuses top-level or descendant reparse points, and compares against an expanded blocklist using case-insensitive equality + prefix matching.
