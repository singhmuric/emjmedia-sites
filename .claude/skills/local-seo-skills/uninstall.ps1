# Local SEO Skills uninstaller for Windows (PowerShell).
#
# Removes $HOME\.claude\skills\localseoskills. By default, any briefs\ directory
# (client data) is backed up to $HOME\.claude\lss-briefs-backup-<timestamp>
# before removal. Pass -NoBackup to skip the backup step.
#
# Compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File uninstall.ps1
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File uninstall.ps1 -Force
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File uninstall.ps1 -NoBackup
