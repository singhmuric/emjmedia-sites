# Local SEO Skills installer for macOS / Linux.
#
# Installs the skills into ~/.claude/skills/localseoskills so Claude Code and
# any agent that reads the Agent Skills spec can discover them. If a previous
# install exists, fetches latest and fast-forwards cleanly, preserving any
# briefs/ directory (client data) by backing it up first.
#
# Usage (curl one-liner, pipes to bash):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrettjsmith/localseoskills/main/install.sh | bash
#
# Or after cloning:
#   bash localseoskills/install.sh
#
# Custom install location:
#   curl -fsSL <url> | LSS_INSTALL_DIR=/custom/path bash

Next steps:
  1. Open Claude Code or your preferred AI agent.
  2. Connect your data tools via MCP. At minimum, LocalSEOData
     (https://localseodata.com). Other supported tools: Local Falcon, LSA Spy,
     SerpAPI, Semrush, Ahrefs, BrightLocal, DataForSEO, Whitespark,
     Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Screaming Frog.
  3. Mention any local business to get started. For example:
       "Audit Mike's Plumbing in Buffalo"
     The agent will ask 5 questions, run an audit, and set up a persistent
     brief for ongoing work.
