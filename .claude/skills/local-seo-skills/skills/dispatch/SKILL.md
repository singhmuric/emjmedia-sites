# Skill Dispatch Guide

When a local SEO request comes in, match it to a pattern below. Load those skills. Don't load everything.

**Default data tool:** `localseodata-tool` — covers most data needs. Load it alongside the relevant strategy skill unless the request specifically needs a different tool.

## When to Load Docs

- Unknown term → `docs/local-seo-glossary`
- Need reasoning about WHY → `docs/how-local-search-works`
- Need to pick a tool → `docs/tool-routing`

## When NOT to Use This Guide

Single-skill requests don't need dispatch. If someone says "how do I write a GBP post" → just load `gbp-posts`.
